# How to run

This project is still in a very early stage, so bugs are more than common and features are extremely limited.
In the future, scripts will be written in its own language called MVScript, but for now, you can (very painfully) write your code in the main function in rust/src/main.rs, then run it with `cargo run -- <source> <flags>`. The source file doesn't matter as it's not used for anything yet.
Check the existing code in the main file for an example of how to write your own script.
